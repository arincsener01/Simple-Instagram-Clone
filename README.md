# Simple-Instagram-Clone
A simple Instagram clone made with PHP.

MySQL was used as the database. Users can see and comment on each other's posts. The user can post in the form of a text or a photo, and can edit and delete this post if he wants. The user can show his own information on his profile and can change the profile and cover photo if he wants. In addition, the "Forgot Password" feature can be used by users and users can change their own passwords.
